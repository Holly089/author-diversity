# author-diversity

created using data scraped from my goodreads account. 
the starting url for the web scraper is the read page in the following format: table view, 20 per page, sorted by date. 
the gender and country living in data was manually gathered and added on by googling info on authors or there goodreads bios. 
the scraped data is supplied in the data folder and is avaliable to reproduce the results. 




when changing one silder it will change data in both the bar graph and map but not update the slider on the other page.
